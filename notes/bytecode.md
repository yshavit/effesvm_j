Outline of a module file
========================================================================================

A text-based Effes bytecode file (`.efct`) is a semi-human-readable, text-based format for defining an Effes module. 

An `.efct` file may contain zero or more of the following, in any order:

- declarations:
  - class declarations
  - functions
- empty lines

Sum types are not declared in module files. They are fully resolved at compile time.

File format
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An `.efct` file is a UTF-8 encoded text file that consists of one or more lines, each of which consist of zero or more tokens. Lines are delimited by a single newline (`\n`) character. When this document discusses any line's contents, those contents do not inlude the trailing newline character. For instance, if the document specifies a line with contents `foo`, the on-disk representation of that line would be `foo\n`.

Within each line, all tokens are strings. If certain opcodes or declarations require non-string operands, the onus is on them (not the `.efct` format parser) to parse the strings.

Tokens are separated by whitespace, as defined by Java's `Character.isWhitespace(int)` function. Tokens have two forms:

- bareword tokens, consiting of one or more non-whitespace, non-hash (`#`) characters (e.g. `foo`)
- quoted tokens, consisting of a double quote (`"`), followed by zero or more characters other than a newline or non-escaped quote, followed by a closing double quoted (e.g. `"foo bar"`)

For both kinds of tokens, the following escape sequences are allowed:

- `\b`, `\t`, `\n`, `\f`, `\r`, `\"`, `\'`, or `\\`, as defined in [JLS 3.10.6][jls-3.10.6]
- `\uXXXX`, where XXXX is a four-digit hexadecimal representing a _single_ code point
- `\u{...}`, where `...` is an arbitrary-length hexadecimal representing a single code point

Note that unlike in Java, higher-plane (supplementary) code points cannot be represented as two `\uXXXX` escapes. For instance, `\uD83D\uDE80` does not represent the rocket character. You should instead use the `\u{...}` form for these code points, as in `\u{1F680}`.

[jls-3.10.6]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.10.6

The first line of an `.efct` file _must_ consist of the following tokens, exactly:

    efct 0

A hash (`#`) not within a quoted token begins a comment. It and the rest of the line are ignored.
    
An empty line is one with no tokens. It is a no-op, except when it serves as the marker for a function body's end, as described below.

Declarations
========================================================================================

Class Declarations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A class declaration creates a simple type. Its name must be unique among all type names in this module. Each declaration is on a single line, and has the format:

    TYPE <name> 0 [constructorArg, ...]

The `0` is a placeholder for generics.

Each constructor arg is specified by name.

Examples:

  TYPE 0 Nothing
  TYPE 0 Id id
  TYPE 0 Pet species legCount

Function declarations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functions start with a declaration:

    FUNC <classname> <functionname> 0 <nLocal> <nArgs>

- The classname must correspond to a type declaration contained in this `.efct` (or `:`, as noted below), and the functionname must be unique within for a given classname.
- nLocal is the number of local variable slots to request (see `pvar`, `svar` below)
- nArgs is the number of arguments this function takes
- The `0` is a placeholder for generics.

After the FUNC line, each non-empty line represents an opcode in that function. The function's body ends at the first empty line.

For instance:

    # FriendBuilder : Person.createFriendBuilder(relationship: Friend | Family | Acquaintance)
    FUNC Person FriendBuilder createFriendBuilder Friend|Family|Acquaintance
    <ops...>

If the classname is `:`, this defines a module function. Otherwise, the 0th arg is implicitly the instance on which the method is invoked, and the method will actually take `nLocal + 1` arguments. For instance, `FUNC Dog eat 0 0 2` will actually take 3 args: a `Dog` reference and the two declared arguments.

A special case of a function declaration is for the module function `main`. The `main` function must have the following declaration:

    FUNC : main 0 <nLocal> 0

This will serve as the entry point for the `.efct`'s execution. Instance functions may also be named `main`, and these have no relation to the module function `main`.

The execution stack
========================================================================================

State is maintained on a LIFO stack. Every item in the stack has a type and a value. The type is one of:

- EffesRef
- Boolean
- Integer (signed 64 integer)

An EffesRef references an object that has:

- a type
- 0 or more constructor arguments, which can be accessed via the _pvar_ opcode (described below)

Operations are always executed within the context of a function (the one exception to this is the initial invocation of a `main` function to start a program, which is handled by the EVM as a special case. But within that `main` function, operands do have the function context). This context includes the number of arguments that the function has.

ops
========================================================================================

Each op is on a line of its own. The first letters of the line define which op it is, and any arguments are separated by spaces. Multiple or trailing spaces are not allowed.

Many of the operands describe popping elements from the stack. Unless noted otherwise, this results in an error if the local stack is empty.

Note that opcodes are only allowed immediately preceding function declarations, and all non-comment lines following those declarations until an empty line are opcodes. This means that even if an opcode shared a name with some other declaration marker (for instance, if we had an opcode `mthd`), there would be no ambiguity, as the file's context makes it clear whether a line is an opcode. That said, by convention opcodes are all lowercase, and other markers are all uppercase, so there shouldn't be any ambiguity.

Description conventions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following opcodes have the following format:

> `opcode` _arg0_ ... _argN_ @pop0 ... @popM -> pushVar

That represents an operation that:

- is identified as `opcode`
- takes N arguments (within the efct line)
- pops M elements from the stack.
- pushes `pushVar` to the stack

All elements other than the opcode name itself are optional in the opcode's description. If they are mentioned in the description, they are _not_ optional when invoking the opcode unless they're surrounded by square brackets.

As mentioned in the [vm-stack][vm-stack] document, elements are described in caller-order, which is the reverse order by which the opcode will see them as it pops them off the stack.

For instance, consider an opcode descibed as:

    regx _where_ @lookIn @pattern -> match

This opcode takes one argument in the `.efct` file, _where_, which for sake of argument we'll say must be either "anywhere" or "full", describing essentially whether to use Java's `Matcher.find` or `Matcher.matches` when executing the regular expression. It will also pop two values off the stack. The first value to be popped is `@pattern` (_not_ `@lookIn`). It will evaluate the regular expression, and then push the match result to the stack.

The opcode might be invoked as:

    str  "foo(.*)" # push the string to the stack
    pvar 0         # pushes local arg 0 to the stack
    regx full      # test whether local arg 0 matches "foo(.*)" in full

[vm-stack]: vm-stack.md

Ops on native types
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Native function calls ("native" in the sense of being handled directly by the EVM) are specified as a separate opcode per call.

These all follow the convention of `call_<type>:<function>`. For instance, `call_String:regex` calls the native `regex` function for String types.

This convention lets the underscore match up with the spaces following 4-char opcodes, such that things line up and generally look nice:

    parg 3
    call : myfunction
    pstr "hello world"
    pstr ".*"
    call_String:regex

Stack manipulation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### pop @ignored

Pops and discards the topmost element of the stack.

### parg _N_ -> argValue

Copies the function argument specified by N onto the stack. N is a textual representation of a non-negative integer, 0-indexed. For instance, "parg 0" pushes the first argument to the stack.

Errors if the argument is out of range (that is, is â‰¥ the number of arguments in the current function).

### pvar _N_ -> varValue

Gets local variable N, and pushes it to the stack. The variable itself is unaffected. This errors if the variable has not been set, or if N is out of range.

### svar _N_ @varValue

Pops the topmost element from the stack, and stores it in local variable N. Errors if N is out of range.

Branching
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### goto _N_

Moves the program counter to the specified opcode. The opcode is an absolute number, 0-indexed, representing an op in the current function. For instance, `goto 0` goes to the first opcode in the function (ie, the opcode represented by the first line of the function body), `goto 3` goes to the fourth, etc.

### goif _N_ @condition

Pops the topmost element, which must be an EffesRef whose type is True or False. Iff the type is True, behaves as the `goto` opcode.

### gofi _N_ @condition

Pops the topmost element, which must be a True or False. Iff the type is False, behaves as the `goto` opcode

### rtrn

Finishes execution of the current function. The current frame must have exactly one value on the stack, which will then be the function's result. Any other state is an error. If a value is returned, its type is not checked.

Functions, field access and object manipulation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### type typedesc @item -> isOfRightType

Pops the topmost item. Pushes a True to the stack iff the item was an EffesRef whose type matched the typedesc, which is something like `List`, `Cat|Dog`, etc. Pushes a False to the stack in all other cases.

### call classname functionname [@arg0 ... arg@1] -> result

Calls a function.

- If _classname_ is `:`, the call is for a module function
- Otherwise, if _functionname_ is the same as _classname_`, this is a constructor call
- Otherwise, the function is a instance method on the class.

This op will pop _n_ args, where _n_ is the number of args the function requires. These are provided in reverse order: the topmost value is the first argument of the function invocation. Instance functions always take at least one argument, and the first argument (that is, the topmost one) must be an EffesRef of the same type that defines the instance function.

This op will push one value to the stack, the function's return value. 

Examples:

- `call Pair Pair` constructs a new Pair instance
- `call : myModuleFunction` calls a function
- `call LinkedList size` calls the `size` function on the `LinkedList` instance represented by the top of the stack.

### oarg name @effesItem -> effesItemField

Pops the topmost item, which must be an EffesRef. Pushes the specified constructor argument (by name) to the top of the stack. Errors if the topmost item is not an EffesRef, or if it is one whose type does not have the requied name.

### call_native:toString @obj -> string

Pops the topmost item, which must be a built-in type (ie, not an EffesRef). Pushes its toString representation as a String.

Array operations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### arry @size -> array

Creates an array of size `@size`.

### call_Array:store @idx @value

Pops an array, an Integer, and an object of unchecked type. Stores the `@value` reference into the array at the specified index.

### call_Array:get @idx -> value

Pops an array and an Integer, and pushes the array value at that index to the stack. If no value has been stored at that index, pushes a `False`.

### call_Array:len -> length

Pops an array, and pushes its length as an Integer.

Boolean operations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### bool str -> boolean

Pushes a True or False to the stack. `str` must be one of `True` or `False` (case sensitive).

### call_Boolean:negate @value -> negation

Pops an element from the stack, which must be True or False, and pushes its negation (False or True, respectively).

### call_Boolean:and / or / xor

Pops two Booleans from the stack, and pushes the result of the logical boolean operation.

Integer operations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### int _N_ -> N

Pushes an Integer to the stack. _N_ is a decimal number, which may be negative. for instance, `int 123` or `int -456`.

### call_Integer:parse @sVal -> iVal

Pops a String from the stack and tries to parse it as an Integer. Pushes the parsed Integer or False if the parsing failed.

Parsing is done via Java's `Integer.parseInt`

### call_Integer:&lt;cmp&gt;

_&lt;cmp&gt;_ is one of: lt, le, eq, ge, gt

Pops two elements from the stack, which must both be of Integer type. Pushes a True if @lhs is less than, less than or equal to, equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to @rhs (respectively, per opcode). Pushes a False otherwise.

### call_Integer:&lt;op&gt; @lhs @rhs -> result

_&lt;op&gt;_ is one of: add, sub, div, mult

Adds, subtracts, divides or multiplies two Integers. Pops two elements from the stack, which must both be of Integer type. Pushes a Integer, which is the result of the operator.

Match operations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### call_Match:igroup @match @captureIdx -> string

Pops a Matcher from the top of the stack. Pushes its Nth group to the stack, or False if the group didn't match.

### call_Match:ngroup @match @captureName -> string

Pops a Matcher from the top of the stack. Pushes the captured group _name_ to the stack, or False if the group didn't match.

### call_Match:groupCount @match -> int

Pops a Matcher from the top of the stack. Pushes the number of captured groups it has, including named captured groups.

String operations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### str _value_ -> value

Pushes a String of type _value_ to the stack.

### call_String:len @str -> len

Pops an element from the stack, which must be a String. Pushes an Integer representing its length (in number of code points, _not_ in terms of 2-byte chars as Java naturally does) to the stack.

### call_String:regex @lookIn @pattern -> didMatch

Pops two elements from the stack, a pattern and a string to search for. Pushes a False if the pattern does not match, or a Match object if it does.

### call_String:sin -> string

Reads a single line from stdin and pushes it to the stack (without the trailing newline), or pushes False is no more lines are available.

### call_String:sout @string

Pops a string from the stack and writes it to stdout. No newline is added.

Other
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### debug-print

Writes a textual representation of the topmost element of the local stack to stderr. Does not modify the stack. Does not error if the local stack is empty; instead, will print to stderr that it is empty.
